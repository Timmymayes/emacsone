*This is a journal entry*

Trying to get used to the Journal for org-mode. I'm not sure what I want to put here though. I think I need to setup a new file "devlog" for development notes on my projects. I need to focus this week on finishing out flexbox and my project. For diet I need to fast. We have a lot of busy times coming up this week. This journal is even an attempt at bringing back and restarting some habits. No matter how short. I need to make a journal entry every day
